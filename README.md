Attempting to solve for organization of budgets into categories and due dates into a visual model that can be overlayed on a calendar. The app enables linking of financial accounts to analyze and organize actual expenses charged and compare budget adherence. Each day tile on the calendar can be zoomed in to see each expense and compare with the toggled overlay to visualize daily spend vs budget. The focus is a seamless blend of everyday budgeting month by month that can zoom out to view yearly budget adherence by category. The target audience is individuals and families who struggle to visualize their budget with other solutions.
